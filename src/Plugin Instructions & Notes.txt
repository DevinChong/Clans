Instructions:
-You can open the skill page by right-clicking on a Bookshelf while wearing a full
 set of Armor
-You can craft Chainmail armor using Iron Gates!
-1.7 (and maybe 1.8) only. Updating takes some effort (thanks bukkit for changing
 changing functions...), but I can create an updated version if you want.

Gameplay Notes:
-All skills are unchanged. Old skills are NOT recovered, except (regular) Quick
 Recovery.
-The Energy bar no longer takes over the EXP bar, however energy still exists!
-Item section/Item tokens removed (you can't get free weapons and items)
-[Proximity Zapper, Proximity Explosive, Water Bottle, Mushroom Soup and Web] can
 all be used by left cliking normal [Redstone Lamp, TNT, Water Bottle, Mushroom Stew, 
 and Cobweb] respectively.

Technical Notes:
-Free Mineplex Anti-Xray included (you can disable in spigot.yml)

Noteable problems:
-Some skills may not work against mobs (ex. Defensive Stance)
-Block Toss duplicate exploit
-Creepers/etc. won't grief because of mechanics relating to reserving block structure.
-Picking up books in the skill page will save if you place it in your inventory, then
 in a chest (but it doesn't do anything except take up space).
-Maybe more, I didn't test it all...
